# factor-analysis

This repository only contains source code for my coursework. It will later be renamed to `coursework-factor-analysis` to avoid misunderstandings.

Data must be named `data.csv` and stored at the root of the repository.

`train.ipynb` contains source code for fitting factor analyzer model. It saves model as `fa.pkl`.

`eval.ipynb` contains source code for analyzing model. Uses `fa.pkl` model.
